                        <p> I am currently a Computer Science undergraduate student at Rutgers University. I've always been fascinated by computers and their ability to solve complex problems since the age of 10. This curiosity, combined with my love for math and science, led me on a path to pursue a degree in Computer Science.</p>

                        <p>I've also excelled in my classes and have always been on the Dean's list since my sophmore year. My academic achievements have motivated me to continue working hard and pushing myself to be the best student I can be.</p>

                        <p>Looking ahead, my plan is to become a software engineer and work tech companies to gain hands-on experience. I'm excited about the opportunities that the field of Computer Science offers, and I'm eager to learn more and develop my skills further.</p>
